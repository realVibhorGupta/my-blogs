## Introduction

Kubernetes deployment strategies are crucial for minimizing downtime during application updates. This article explains three strategies:

**Rolling Update**, which allows zero-downtime upgrades;

**Canary**, for gradual traffic shifting to new versions;

**Blue-Green**, which involves maintaining parallel environments for quick rollbacks.

Each deployment strategy has unique advantages and use cases. Understanding these strategies in Kubernetes is crucial for maintaining service availability during upgrades, minimizing downtime, and protecting revenue and user experience.

## **Rolling Update**

The default deployment method in Kubernetes is the **rolling update**, which gradually replaces the old version with the new one, ensuring continuous service availability. The **canary deployment strategy** involves releasing a new version to a small user subset first, allowing for monitoring and risk reduction. **Blue-green deployment** maintains two environments—one with the current version and another with the new version—facilitating quick switching without downtime.

Kubernetes employs rolling updates to manage version upgrades with minimal downtime. This method allows for incremental updates, ensuring the application remains operational throughout the process. If a new version fails to initialize, existing replicas of the old version continue serving traffic, preserving user experience. Default parameters like Max unavailable and Max surge, both set to 25%, help maintain stability during updates.

A configured Readiness probe is essential for ensuring that new replicas are prepared to accept traffic during a rolling update. Without it, traffic may be sent to containers that are not ready, leading to issues. While rolling updates help minimize downtime, some can still occur due to integration delays with databases and microservices. Testing updates in a Kubernetes cluster is possible with commands like '**kubectl create deploy**' and '**kubectl get pods**,' offering practical insights into the update process.

Rolling updates aim for zero downtime by gradually replacing old application versions, allowing users to access applications without interruptions even during updates. This strategy promotes smooth transitions, with some replicas remaining operational while new ones are deployed, significantly reducing user disruption. However, other strategies like canary and blue-green deployments also address specific needs that rolling updates may not meet. Testing across UAT and QA environments is crucial to catch potential issues before production deployment.

## Canary deployment

The canary deployment model allows for gradual rollouts of new software versions, minimizing user impact by directing traffic between old and new versions. A small percentage of users receive the new version while most continue to use the old one, enabling immediate feedback from a limited user base. This strategy also allows for quick rollbacks to the previous version in case of major issues, enhancing stability for the majority of users, unlike rolling updates where all users may experience problems simultaneously. The choice of deployment strategy should depend on the application’s criticality and user experience expectations.

The **Kary model** provides better control during software updates by allowing gradual traffic shifts, contrasting with rolling updates that quickly replace all instances. If one instance succeeds, all others are updated quickly, which can cause problems if the new version has bugs. The Kary model enables teams to validate new versions by controlling traffic distribution, ensuring quality assurance before full deployment. An Ingress controller is essential for managing traffic and load balancing within Kubernetes clusters, playing a key role in implementing the Kary deployment strategy effectively.

Creating an **Ingress resource** for both versions involves configuring traffic distribution, facilitating a controlled rollout of new features. When setting up Ingress for the new version, an annotation specifies the traffic percentage for each version. Testing the traffic distribution with the curl command ensures the requests are balanced as intended. After initial tests, traffic percentages can be adjusted based on feedback, optimizing the deployment process over time.

Canary deployment allows for real-time testing in a production environment by gradually shifting traffic between versions, helping teams identify potential issues prior to full deployment. This controlled rollout can direct 70% of traffic to the stable version, maintaining user experience and minimizing risks. Testing in production often uncovers issues that lower environments miss, making canary deployments vital for quality assurance and enhancing confidence in new releases. Conversely, blue-green deployment offers a safe switch by maintaining two identical environments, enabling quick rollback if problems arise, though it can be more costly due to resource duplication.

## Blue-Green deployment

While effective, the blue-green deployment strategy requires managing Ingress resources to forward traffic to the desired service, facilitating smooth transitions with minimal downtime. Its resource-intensive nature may limit broader adoption, especially in environments with multiple services. However, in cost-sensitive environments like banking, blue-green deployment is preferred for its rapid rollback capabilities, ensuring high availability for critical applications.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right Kubernetes deployment strategy is key to keeping your application available and your users happy during updates. Each method—Rolling Update, Canary, and Blue-Green—has its own perks to minimize downtime and boost stability. The Rolling Update method makes gradual changes with little impact, while Canary deployments let you test in a focused way and lower risks. Blue-Green deployments allow for quick rollbacks with parallel environments. By understanding and using these strategies, your team can work more efficiently and keep your users satisfied in today’s fast-paced digital world. It's important to carefully consider your application needs and user expectations to implement these strategies successfully.
