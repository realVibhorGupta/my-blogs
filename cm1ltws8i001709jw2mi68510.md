The Kubernetes file is in YAML format, as everyone knows. It is generally broken down into three categories:

1. Metadata
    
2. Specifications
    
3. Stateful files/Status
    

**Metadata**

In the metadata, all the information regarding the deployment is written, like names, labels, etc., which are used by the cluster to identify the deployment.

**Specifications**

These are the details regarding the types of deployments installed, like pods and services. It contains the number of replicas, selectors, and templates.

The templates contain details about the specific pods, such as name, label, and other information about the deployment type.

3. Status

The statuses are auto-generated by Kubernetes when a deployment is made. It is called status because Kubernetes provides a feature that checks the status of the deployment, i.e., the current state and desired state. Its goal is to maintain the desired state of the deployment based on the config file. All details are stored in the etcd component. If a pod crashes for some reason, KKubernetes will generate the relevant pods and services based on the config file to match the desired state. It contains all the replica set information and other detailed info regarding the states of all the deployments.
