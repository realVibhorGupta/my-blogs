In this article, we're going to discuss a very important topic: security in Kubernetes and some best practices for securing your Kubernetes cluster. The big challenge we see with Kubernetes security is that setting up a Kubernetes cluster and configuring it to deploy applications is already very difficult, so security often becomes an afterthought. Adding security on top of this complex configuration can be overwhelming. However, we can't ignore the importance of security, especially with such complex systems. So, first of all, let's talk about security in the cloud.

In general, there is a trend of more workloads moving to the cloud. Often, there is a misconception that the cloud is secure by default. People think that because an application is on the cloud, it is protected. However, it is important to understand that you need to secure and manage your infrastructure and applications on the cloud just as you would on-premise. The difference is that on the cloud, you have different tools and technologies to configure that security. Many organizations are either unaware of these tools or are not using them effectively to secure their cloud environment. As a result, cloud applications become attractive targets for hackers. Most of these growing cloud-native applications use Kubernetes as a platform, which is why knowing how to secure Kubernetes clusters is so important.

So, the question is, how secure is Kubernetes by default? If I don't change any settings and use the defaults, what is my security status? What are we starting with, and what vulnerabilities or security gaps exist in Kubernetes? What are the best practices to protect and close those gaps to secure our systems?

The most common issue is when someone gains access from the Kubernetes platform to the underlying operating system. In this case, an attacker can cause significant damage to the entire system. This can happen due to various misconfigurations, and we'll discuss those and how to protect your Kubernetes setup to prevent this.

When we talk about security, it's important to understand that it's a combination of multiple factors at different levels. It's not just one or two actions that secure everything. In the case of Kubernetes, we have the underlying infrastructure, the Kubernetes platform running on that infrastructure, and the applications running inside the Kubernetes platform.

All these levels need to be secured individually, which is quite challenging. One of the main challenges in security is that attackers have an advantage because they only need to find one weak link to exploit. In contrast, defenders must protect every single point, often multiple times, to prevent attacks. In many cases, we need to defend each point with multiple mechanisms.

While coding best practices suggest not repeating logic, security best practices actually encourage redundancy. Using multiple security measures to protect each attack point ensures that an attacker has to overcome several barriers to access your system or valuable resources and cause damage to your environment.

## Now, let's dive into the 10 security best practices.

Let's dive into some best practices for Kubernetes security. First, let's understand the main purpose of Kubernetes: it's to run applications inside containers. So, when we build an application and deploy it in Kubernetes, securing those workloads starts even before they get deployed. This begins with building a secure container image in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Building Secure Container Images

Container images are built in layers, each containing commands, tools, configurations, etc. We need to be mindful of everything that goes into these images and their security implications. For instance, using code or libraries from untrusted sources can introduce vulnerabilities like viruses or backdoors. Similarly, operating system packages and base images might have their own vulnerabilities. Therefore, it's crucial to be selective about the libraries, dependencies, and tools we use.

Developers should eliminate unnecessary packages, libraries, and dependencies that the application doesn't need at runtime. Opt for leaner and smaller base images with fewer tools. If an image with vulnerabilities gets deployed, it can lead to serious security issues. An attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities to break out of the container and access the host or Kubernetes worker node, potentially causing widespread damage.

## Image Scanning

To prevent such vulnerabilities, we should perform image scanning. Tools like Sysdig and Snyk can help by scanning images against a database of known vulnerabilities. It's essential to scan images in the CI/CD pipeline before pushing them to the repository. Regularly scan images already in the repository to catch any newly discovered vulnerabilities.

## Avoid Using Root User

Another best practice is to avoid using the root user in containers and running containers with privileges. If an image with vulnerabilities runs as root, an attacker can more easily break out and access the host. Instead, create a service user and run the application with that user. Be cautious with pod configurations to avoid misconfigurations that allow running as root or with privileges.

## Securing the Cluster

Once the application is deployed, securing the cluster itself is crucial. This involves managing who can access the cluster and their privileges. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) helps manage users, roles, and permissions. Assign roles with specific permissions to users and service accounts, ensuring the least privilege approach.

## Network Policies

Inside the cluster, limit communication between pods using network policies. Define rules to control which pods can talk to each other. For example, a front-end service should only communicate with the back-end service, not the database. Network policies are implemented by network plugins like Calico or Weave.

## Service Mesh

For more granular control, use a service mesh like Istio. It uses proxies in each pod to control traffic and can enable mutual TLS for encrypted communication between services. This adds an extra layer of security by encrypting internal communication.

## Securing Secrets

Kubernetes secrets, used for sensitive data like credentials and tokens, are not encrypted by default. Enable encryption for secrets using Kubernetes' encryption configuration or third-party tools like AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault. These tools help manage encryption keys and securely store secrets.

## Securing etcd Store

The etcd store, which holds Kubernetes configuration data, must be secured. Put it behind a firewall, allow only the API server to access it, and enable encryption for the data. This prevents attackers from making direct changes to the etcd store.

## Data Security

Data security is paramount. Implement an automated backup and restore system for your cluster. Tools like Kasten K10 can help configure automated backups and ensure data is securely transferred and stored. Protect backups from being corrupted or manipulated by attackers.

## Disaster Recovery Plan

Finally, have a disaster recovery plan in place. Use tools like Kasten K10 for automated recovery, ensuring minimal downtime and impact on user experience. Test your recovery plan to ensure it works effectively in case of an attack.

## Conclusion

By following these best practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your Kubernetes cluster. Share your experiences and any additional security practices you find important in the comments.
